# Retail-Profit-Risk-Audit
An end-to-end strategic audit of a retail dataset (1,850+ SKUs) using SQL and Power BI to identify margin leakage and inventory fragmentation. This project utilizes advanced DAX modeling, SQL window functions, and Pareto analysis to transform raw sales data into a tactical "inventory rationalization" roadmap.
